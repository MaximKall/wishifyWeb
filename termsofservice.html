                    law provisions. Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those

                <p>
                    If any provision of these Terms is held to be unenforceable or invalid, such provision will be changed and interpreted
                    to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law, and the remaining
                    provisions will continue in full force and effect.
